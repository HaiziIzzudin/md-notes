## TOPIC 3: BC HISTORY & DEVELOPMENT
| Item | Definition |
|-|-|
|OI, development|**ANTIQUITY:** Sumerian tablet (oldest list of books) found at Nippur. The Hittites recorded bibliographic info which includes colophons (set of data at the end of document, that tracks kinds of bibliographic data). Citzens in Nineveh developed library that has collection with systematic means of order and authenticity. Greek civilization has contributed the "main entry" concept. <br><br> **MIDDLE AGE:** Catalogs of library holdings were largely consists of small collections. There is evidence of very broad subject arrangements, which usually Biblical and Humanistic. Registrum Librorum Angliae, a union list of holdings of English monastery libraries. <br><br> **RENAISSANCE:** Printing press was invented, creating explosion in publishing and duplicate copies of works. St. Martins Priory designate first list as a catalog. Andrew Maunsell, as English Bookseller, introduces entry of personal names listed under surnames rather than forenames, which promoted early developments of BC. <br><br> **INVENTORY TO CODIFYING DEVICES:** **Konrad Gesner** published an author bibliography and subject index. **Frederic Rostgaard** published discourse on cataloging and also promoted supplementary author index. French is the first national catalog to catalog libraries' collection throughout France. **Anthony Panizzi**, advocator of cataloging and subject analysis has authored a cataloging code "91 rules". **Panizzi** was a modern theories of cataloging. **Charles C. Jewett** marked the introduction of the American influence to cataloging and arrangement which build on Panizzi’s earlier efforts. **Charles Cutter** published Printed Dictionary Catalogue. He was the first to establish rules for subject headings. <br><br> **20TH CENTURY:** In 1908, the British and Americans collaborated on a code, which saw a second edition in 1941. This edition divided the code into two parts: entry and heading, and description. It was the first international cataloging code. In 1942, The LC Rules for Descriptive Cataloging replaced the second part of the British and American effort, due to criticism from Andrew Osborn's "The Crisis in Cataloging." In 1967, the Americans and British established AACR, leading to the publication of AACR2 in 1978. This update accommodated developments from ISBD, addressed non-book materials, integrated machine processing of bibliographic records, and reconciled the British and American texts. A significant revision of AACR2 took place in 2002, but it was later supplanted by the creation of RDA.
|Subject access, development|A.L.A. List of subject heading first published in 1885, then 2nd revision is made in 1905. In 1914, the 1st edition of Subject Headings Used in the Dictionary Catalogs of LC was published. In 1923, SEARS was published. It was prepared by Minnie Earl Sears which suitable for small libraries. In 1975, the title of LC’s was changed to LCSH, which every new edition is published every year between 1998 until 2007. In 2009, LCSH is updated weekly in its online version.|
|Classification, development|In 1814, LC introduced 18 broad categories in the Bacon-d’ Alembert system. In 1876, **Melvil Dewey** issued first edition of DDC. He divided all knowledge into ten main classes, with divided again into ten division, and each divided into ten sections. In early 1930, S.R. Raganathan used the term facet in his Colon Classification. In 1895, Paul Otlet and Henri LaFontaine developed UDC which expanded DDC by the addition of detailed subdivisions and the use of symbols to indicate complex subjects. In 20th century, Faceted classification was introduced. All aspects of interdisciplinary subject was arranged in the same classification notation. (aka Analytico synthetic)|
