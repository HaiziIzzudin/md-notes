Advantages to businesses | <li> Businesses can save on system design, installation, and maintenance. <li> Increased efficiency and reduce the costs of new product and service launches <li> Employees can access corporate systems from any Internet-connected computer
Public Cloud  | <li> A service provider owns and manages the infrastructure with cloud user organizations (tenants) accessing slices of shared hardware resource via the Internet <li> Cloud service maintained by an external service provider, access through the Internet and available to the public. <li> Public cloud computing can be a faster, cheaper, and more agile approach to building and managing your own IT infrastructure <li> Data security is a key concern
Public Cloud | Divided into three main types of services: <li> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) <li> Software as a service (SaaS) <li> Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) | Software as a service (SaaS) is a method for delivering software applications over the internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) | Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS| The most basic category of cloud computing services. With infrastructure as a service (laaS), you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Serverless Computing | Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.
Private Cloud | <li> A single tenant cloud <li> Organization often implement due to concerns that their data will not be secure in a public cloud <li>Can be divided into two types: <br>1) On-premise private cloud <br>2) Service provider managed private cloud.

|-|-|
What is SOFTWARE ISSUES AND TRENDS? | <ol><li>In software testing circles, it denotes the existence of some anomaly or flaw in a software system that requires resolution. Therefore, an issue can be anything from a bug, missing or incorrect documentation, a request for changing a feature, or some other task to be accomplished<li>Software trends refer to any latest discovery and advancement that grab an eye of attention of many users whereas the capability of the software found to be meaningful and useful for usage.<li>There are various types of software issues and trends exist align with the rapid development of IT/IS worldwide
MOBILE APPLICATION SOFTWARE | <li> A mobile application or app is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch.<li>The applications are built as a miniature icon which is limited to a certain extent of functions and generally developed by any coding languages.<li> Each application provides individual functionalities and enables multitasking. <li> It allows the user to choose their preferred applications according to their demand. <li> The applications are designed as a classy approach which has is its own advantages and limitations and its surpassed by the intelligent accessibility by the user.
TYPES OF MOBILE APPLICATION SOFTWARE | <br>The widely available mobile software is divided into the main three categories: <ol><li> **Native Applications**<br> - The native application has broad access to visual and structural elements that is available in storage space. <br> - The application is used to save the marketing advantages and limitations such as data interpretations and ranking but its restricted for its own demands. <br> - The development cost is higher than other applications since it is widely deployed on multiple platforms. The native applications are generally built with a familiar Operating system and user-friendly interface but the portability of the code cannot be deployed in other applications. <br> - The maintenance of this application is higher similar to the installation cost. <br> - This native application is mostly employed for the stable process which needs high optimization.<li> **Hybrid Applications** <br> - They are similar to native applications and used in multiple environments but it requires only a minimum cost set up. It requires advanced skills for its development. <br> - The application content is limited until the icon wrapper whereas all the data are executed and loaded from slower which requires maximum response time. <br> - The initial installation cost is free and it is now increasing in the market rate. <br> - They are available similar to API but have low-quality features. <br> - It cannot give a complete experience as a native application but combining with UI and UX it can give a partial native view. <br> - Most of the code can be portable and deployed to other platforms.<li> **Web Applications**<br> - The applications are available in an online browser which is accessible only with the availability of internet connection. <br> - The performance of these applications is calculated by the speed of the internet connection and browser loading time.  <br> - It is available at a cheap rate because of its unit codes. <br> - There are many advantages to this application but it is used only by fourteen percent of the people in the world. <br> - The monetization can be gained by publishing advertisements and flashcard subscriptions.  <br> - It is limited to some API such as marking geo-locations. This application is developed by using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. <br> - It is portable and its deployed in any web browsers with faster execution.

It helps the user to launch his brand through advertisement and digital marketing which saves time and cost.
USING APPLICATION SAFELY<br>before installing an app... | <br> Before you install an app, here’s what you can do to better protect your privacy:<ol><li> Use official app stores. To reduce the risk of installing potentially harmful apps, download apps only from official app stores, such as your device’s manufacturer or operating system app store. Also, research the developer before installing an app.<li>Know what information the app will be able to access. Before you download an app, read the app’s privacy policy to see how your data will be used or if your data will be shared. Is the policy vague about how the app will share your data? If it is, or if you’re not comfortable with how your information could be shared, you might want to find another app. <li> Check out the permissions. To gain access to information like your location or contacts or to get access to features like your camera and microphone, apps need your permission. You may be asked to give permission when you first download the app, or at the time the app first tries to access that information or feature. Pay close attention to the permissions the app requests. For example, does it really need to access your location or photos to do its job?
USING APPLICATION SAFELY<br>Your privacy on Apps you already have. | <ol><li>Review the app’s permissions. Go to your settings to review the permissions to make sure the app doesn’t have access to information or features it doesn’t need. Turn off unnecessary permissions. Consider deleting apps that need a lot of permissions – some apps request lots of permissions that aren’t needed for the app’s function. Pay special attention to apps that have access to your contact list, camera, storage, location, and microphone.<li>Limit location permissions. Some apps have access to your device’s location services. If an app needs access to your location data to function, think about limiting the access to only when the app is in use.<li>Don’t automatically sign in to apps with a social network account. Signing in to an app with your social network account information often lets the app collect information from your social network account and vice versa. If you aren’t OK with that, use your email address and a unique password to sign in.<li>Keep apps updated. Apps with out-of-date software may be at risk of being hacked. Protect your device from malware by installing app updates as soon as they’re released.<li>Delete apps you don’t need. To avoid unnecessary data collection, if you’re not using an app, delete it.
COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE | <ol><li>Software copyright is the legal protection for code meant to be read by a machine. It is used by software developers and owners to keep people from copying their intellectual property without permission or from using it in any way they haven't agreed to.<li>A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software. Software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights.<li>When you purchase software, you receive a copy of the software and a license to use it. You don't actually own the software—ownership rights belong to the software company, and you're still limited by the terms and conditions of the license.
TYPES OF SOFTWARE LICENSES | ![5 types software licaense](image-23.png)
SOFTWARE UPGRADES | <ol><li>Software Upgrade means a new version of the Software that includes new and/or different features from the previous version, as opposed to corrections to already existing features.<li>For example, going from version 1.0 to 2.0 in software is a major upgrade. These upgrades may also have version names associated with them such as Windows 10 or macOS Catalina. The rightmost number in a software's version number generally represents minor updates. Going from version 3.0.<li>Software updates provide more than just security updates, they often offer new and improved features and speed enhancements to make the end-user experience better.
