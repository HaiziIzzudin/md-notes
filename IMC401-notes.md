What is ICT? | ICT is the technology required for information processing, in particular, the use of electronic computers, communication devices and software applications to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve information from anywhere, anytime.
Information|***The knowledge obtained from reading, investigation, study or research.***<br>The tools to transmit information are the telephone, television and radio. We need information to make decisions and to predict the future.
Communication|***Communication is an act of transmitting messages.*** It is a process whereby information is exchanged between individuals using symbols, signs or verbal interactions. Communication is important in order to gain knowledge.
What is Digital Literacy? | ***It is the ability to understand and use information in multiple formats from a wide range of sources when it is presented via computers.***<br>It involves any number of digital reading and writing techniques across multiple media forms, including words, texts, visual displays, motion graphics, audio, video, and multimodal forms.
