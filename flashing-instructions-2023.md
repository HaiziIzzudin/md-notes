# STEP 0: INITIALS AND REQUIRED FILES

## 0.1  Unlock your device
This steps only going to be doce once, unless you had lock it before and decided to unlock it again.
For Xiaomi device, you are required to link your device to your Xiaomi Account, afterwards there is a time period before you can unlock your phone.
Get the unlock tool form [MIUI Unlock Website](https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html), and follow the program instructions.

## 0.2 Download and install custom recovery
1. Download the [latest stable OrangeFox Recovery](https://orangefox.download/release/642c1d0e3b7efd4549c74e47).
2. If not installed yet, please [download latest platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) following your platform type.
   - After download complete, unzip the file.
   - Locate the unzipped folder.
   - Option 1: You can add the folder to Environment Variable, and access it directly (hard to setup, but convenient later), OR
   - Option 2: Open terminal, and navigate directly to the unzipped folder, and open terminal from the folder (no setupping, but very inconvenient)
   - Either way, the result should be the same.
4. Go to fastboot mode:
   - Turn off your device.
   - Then, press and hold `Power` + `Volume Down` button simultaneously, until a `FASTBOOT` screen appear.
   - Connect your device to your PC.
