## TOPIC 2: OI IN DIFFERENT ENVIORNMENTS
| Item | Definition |
|-|-|
|Define Information Institutions|Institution or center to organize and provide information so that it will be retrievable for various purposes and also provide resources, services to the users.|
|Types of information agencies|<ol><li>Library<li> Museum<li> Digital library and archive<li> Archive<li> Art Gallery<li> The Internet<li> Knowledge Center<li> Record Center|
|1. Libraries|Rely on efforts of collection development to fulfill their missions.|
|Library developments|<ol><li>**Selection:** learn about existing and new works from reviews, publishers' announcement, requests from patrons.<li>**Gifts and Exchanges:** Gifts donated from interested party. Exchanges mutual beneficial trade agreement with one or more other libraries.<li>**Approval plan:** Prearranges relationships with book vendors that supply titles based on a pre-designed profile. <li>**Patron driven accusations:** Library obtains certain resouces only after the need for them has been definitively established.|
|Explain organization process in library |<ol><li> **Arrange and Classify:** Arranged by alphabetically, Dewey Decimal Classification, Library of Congress Classification. <li> **Cataloguing & Classification Process:** Creating a description of the physical item, choosing certain names and title as access points, authority work, subject analysis, creating a call number.<li>**MARC (Machine Readable Format):** This information is almost always entered in the MARC record where it becomes electronically retrievable in the form of union catalogs (i.e. OCLC, TRLN, WNCLN, UNC Coastal Library Consortium, etc).|
|2. Digital Library|A collection of Information Resources in digital form that are selected, brought together, organized, preserved, and to which access is provided over digital networks for a particular community of users.|
|Explain organization process in digital library|<ol><li>Selection of documents and scanning<li>Storage and management standards<li>Search and access<li>Distribution<li>Rights management|
|3. Archive|Consists of unique items, preserving records of enduring value. Archive records are organized and described in groups.|
|Principles of arranging archive|<li>**Provenance:** Originator that created, gathered or maintained the collection before it was sent to archive. The ownership history of a particular artifacts/collection of archival information.<li>**Original Order:** The sequence in which the originator of an archival collection kept or created the collection.|
|3 distinct activities in processing archival collections|<ol><li>Gather and analysing information about the collection (a.k.a. *Accession records*).<li>Organizing and arranging the collection.<li>Create *finding aids* to provide access to the collection.|
|How archive is being kept?|Generally housed in boxes kept in closed stacks, accessible only to staff. |
|Accession records|Summarizes information about source of collection, briefly describes the physical data and contents for a collection.|

|4. Museum and Art Gallery; Types of collection|Visual material in 2D or 3D form.|
|*Remark*|Collections are less standardized as result are less likely to be retrieved electronically.|
|Principles of organization in Museum & Art Gallery|<ol><li>**Provenance:** Essential in determining name and elements describing the particular object.<li>**Accession record:** Groups of singular objects are described as a single lot that is given asingle accession number.<li>**Register:** It serves as a catalog, where it establishes the organizational control over works and artifacts.|
|Challenges|<ol><li>Objects are often imperfectly known at the time of accessioning and registering, there is a chance of accumulation of conflicting over time.<li>Lack of text make interpretation of item or collection more subjective.|

## TOPIC 3: BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL: DEFINITION, PURPOSE, HISTORY & DEVELOPMENT
| Item | Definition |
|-|-|
|Bibliographic control|Refers to operation by which recorded information is organized or arranged according to established standards and thereby made readily identifiable and retrieveable.|
|Hierarchy of BC type|Bibliographic files/ database (if automated), individual units of such is bibliographic records.|
|3 Main activities of BC|<ol><li>Indexing and abstracting<li>Resource description and subject analysis<li>Classification|
|Purpose of BC|<ol><li>Facilitating access to documents or materials.<li> Guidance in searching information. <li> Vital element for effective reference & information services. <li> Recording and expanding knowledge. <li> Stimulating R&D <li> Encouraging cooperation, exchange and sharing of information between institutions and nations. <li> Avoiding duplication in R&D.|
|Development of organization of information in Western civilization|**ANTIQUITY:** Sumerian tablet (oldest list of books) found at Nippur. The Hittites recorded bibliographic info which includes colophons (set of data at the end of document, that tracks kinds of bibliographic data). Citzens in Nineveh developed library that has collection with systematic means of order and authenticity. Greek civilization has contributed the "main entry" concept. <br><br> **MIDDLE AGE:** Catalogs of library holdings were largely consists of small collections. There is evidence of very broad subject arrangements, which usually Biblical and Humanistic. Registrum Librorum Angliae, a union list of holdings of English monastery libraries. <br><br> **EURO RENAISSANCE:** Printing press was invented, creating explosion in publishing and duplicate copies of works. St. Martins Priory designate first list as a catalog. Andrew Maunsell, as English Bookseller, introduces entry of personal names listed under surnames rather than forenames, which promoted early developments of BC. <br><br> **INVENTORY TO CODIFYING DEVICES:** **Konrad Gesner** published an author bibliography and subject index. **Frederic Rostgaard** published discourse on cataloging and also promoted supplementary author index. The French government instructed to catalog the libraries' collection that has been confiscated throughout France (the first national catalog). Libraries made the first instance of a card catalogs. **Anthony Panizzi** advocated of cataloging and subject analysis. He authored a cataloging code called "91 rules". **Panizzi** was a modern theories of cataloging. **Charles C. Jewett** marked the introduction of the American influence to cataloging and arrangement. Jewett build on Panizzi’s earlier efforts. **Charles Cutter** published Printed Dictionary Catalogue. Cutter’s efforts emphasis on establishing rules on filing entries. Cutter was also the first to establish rules for subject headings. In 1876, **Melvil Dewey** issued anonymously the first edition of his classification, Dewey Decimal Classification. Dewey divided all knowledge into ten main classes, with each of those divided again into ten division, and each of those divided into ten sections. <br><br> **20TH CENTURY:** The British and the Americans collaborated on a code in 1908. This collaboration was significant, because it serves as the first international cataloging code to be established. Americans and Italians collaborated to publish the Vatican Code. It was quickly accepted by catalogers in many countries as the best and most complete code in existence. The British and the Americans cooperated on publishing a second edition to the volume that was written in 1908. This code was written in two parts: one for entry and heading, and one for description. The Library of Congress (LC) Rules for Descriptive Cataloging, served as a substitute to the second part of the British and the American effort. The revisions, A.A.A Cataloging rules for Author and Title Entries, were written after criticism by Andrew Osborn in his article entitled “The Crisis in Cataloging”. The Americans and the British collaborated to establish the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. Because there was disagreement on a few points, this work was published in two separate versions: North American and British. Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) is founded to develop a computerized system in which the libraries of Ohio academic institutions could share resources and reduce costs. The AACR2 was published to accommodate the developments established by the ISBD, to address non book materials, to take into account machine processing of bibliographic records, and to reconcile the British and American texts. A significant revision of AACR2 is made in 2002. Updates of AACR2 have ceased, as efforts are now focused on the creation of a new description cataloging content standard, RDA: Resources Description and Access.
|The development of subject access|Plato, Aristotle, Bacon and Plato among the famous philosopher. A.L.A. List of subject heading first published in 1885, then 2nd revision is made in 1905. In 1914, the 1st edition of Subject Headings Used in the Dictionary Catalogs of the Library of Congress (LC) was published. In 1923, Sears List of Subject Headings (Sears) was published. It was prepared by Minnie Earl Sears which suitable for small libraries. In 1975, the title of LC’s was changed to Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH), which every new edition is published every year between 1998 until 2007. In 2009, LCSH is updated weekly in its online version.|
|Development of Classification|In 1814, Library of Congress (LC) introduced 18 broad categories in the Bacon-d’ Alembert system. In early 1930, S.R. Raganathan used the term facet in his Colon Classification. In 1895, Belgian Laywers; Paul Otlet and Henri LaFontaine developed Universal Decimal Classification. It expanded DDC by the addition of detailed subdivisions and the use of symbols to indicate complex subjects. In 20th century, Faceted classification was introduced. All aspects of interdisciplinary subject was arranged in the same classification notation. (aka Analytico synthetic)|

## TOPIC 4: RETRIEVAL TOOLS
| Item | Definition |
|-|-|
|Retrieval tools|A systems created to help users to find, identify, select, and obtain information resources in all types. They contain records that act as surrogate record (aka called description or metadata).|
|Surrogate record|A short representation for information resources and facilitate access to an individual information resource in a collection. Surrogate records are arranged and retrieved by *access points*.|
|Access point| It can be a name, title or subject term chosen by an indexer or a cataloger. <br> In online systems an access point can be almost any word in a record if keyword searching of every word (except “stopword”) is allowed.|
|List of basic retrieval tools|<ol><li>Bibliographies<li>Catalogs<li>Indexes<li>Abstracts<li>Finding Aids<li>Registers and Other Museum Databases<li>Search engines and directories<li>Bibliographic databases: LC Online Catalog<li>Bibliographic utilities: OCLC, RLIN, SILAS, AMICUS WEB|
|**1**<br>Define bibliographies|Lists of information resources based on subject matter, on authors or by time periods.|
|Bibliography styles| <li> APA (American Psychological Association) <li> Chicago Manual Style <li> MLA (Modern Language Association) <li> Science (Scientific Style and Format) <li> Turabian Style Manual (US Government Style Manual)|

|Annotated bibliography|Brief notes or abstracts that offer additional comment or summary of a particular work.|
|**2** <br> Define catalogs|Provide access to individual items within collections of information packages. |
|*Remark*|Catalogs provides description of the information package longer than a bibliography description. <br> An access points is constructed in a certain order (e.g.: surname followed by forename) and it is maintained under authority control. <br> Catalog also act as an inventory of the collection – shelf list has been used to accomplish this purpose. <br> Catalog represents just the holdings of one institution.|
|Standards of catalogs|<li> AACR2 for libraries, some archives and museums <li> GILS for some government information packages <li> Dublin Core for Internet information packages etc.|
|Purpose of catalogs|<li> To enable a person to find a book of which either by The author, The title, or The subject is known. <li> To show what the library has by a given author, on a given subject, in a given kind of literature <li> To assist in the choice of a book.|
|Serving of catalogs|<li> Employees/librarians of the organization <li> Users / patrons of the organization|
|Example of catalog record|[attach photo]|
|Union catalog|Represents the holding of more than one institution that have the location of the item being held beside than the call number.|
|Who's maintaining union catalog?|Normally union catalog will be maintained by bibliographic utilities such as OCLC (Online Computer Library Center)|
|Why Internet serve as a giant union catalog?| Because online catalog comply to Z39.50 protocol. Z39.50 allows user to search another computer and transfer search results without user having to know the search commands of the remote computer.|

|Arrangements of catalog|<ol><li>Alphabetically <li>Subject <li>Authors <li>Titles <li>Internal accession numerical sequence <li>Numerically <li>Classification|
|**3**<br> Define Indexes|Provide access to the analysed contents of "bibliographic entities".|
|Back-of-the-book indexes|Provide access to analyzed contents of one work but they are not retrieval tools but aid to retrieve information found in the text. They are prepared at the time of publication.|
|Web sites indexes|A-Z indexes.<br>The process of web indexing usually used HTML indexer and XRefHT32.|
|Sample entries from the printed version of the index Library Literature & Information Science|[insert photo]|
|Types of indexes|<li>**SERIALS** indexes to report both published & unpublished government documents <li>**MATERIALS IN COLLECTION INDEXES** cover collections of poems, play, fiction, song etc. (The Speech Index)<li> **PERIODICAL/GENERAL INDEX** cover many periodicals in a broad or specific subject field (The Reader Guide to Periodical Literature). <li> **SUBJECT INDEXES** index material in a narrow subject field (Library Literature) <li> **NEWSPAPER INDEXES** (Indeks Suratkhabar Malaysia)|
|Periodical Index Online |A database of millions of citations for articles published in the arts, humanities and social sciences, across more than 300 years.|

|**4**<br> Define abstracts|A summary of current bibliography like book or articles.|
|Format of abstracts|Arrange under broad subject headings, with appropriate author & subject indexing.|
|Purpose of abstracts|<li>To help the users in deciding whether the contents of the paper are such that they need to read it in full. <li>To save the user’s time in information gathering and selection.|
|**5**<br> Define finding aids| Long descriptions of archival collections (aka inventory).|
|Function of finding aids|<li>Finding aids describes a collection in archives. <li>The finding aids itself is often catalogued – a surrogate record to be available in the institution’s catalog.|
|Types of information found in a finding aid|<ol><li>**Provenance:** creator/title/dates/biographical history<Li> **Physical extent and condition:** Number, vol., and statement of the collection’s condition<li> **Scope and content notes:** Nature of the collection such types of materials, access points, subjects etc. <li> **Order and structure:** How the collection is arranged and organized. <li> **Administrative information:** Location/ condition of use/ restriction/ citation/ accession/ repository/ conservation information.|

|How register is processed?|During registration process, the registrar will identify the object, the donor, any associations, any information needed for insurance purposes, etc. An identification number is assigned|
|**7** <br>Search Engine| *Refer Chapter 2: Search Engines*|
|Purpose of search engines|<li>To search full text documents for particular words or phrases.<li>To search only a particular resource (such as Website for an organization)/ the whole internet.|
|Search engine use of spider/crawler/robot/agent|The spider is programmed to go to the Web to retrieve and download copies of certain target webpages and everything linked to them.|
|How it works?|Search engine automatically collects information from Web Resources and places it into a database of records or in a full text index database.|
||[compare search engine vs web dir]|
|What is web directories?|<ol><li>Alternative to search engines.<li>Employs human indexers in the creation of its directory.<li>Human add the subject terms and categorize the records into a hierarchical subject tree index.<li>Search the Directories: Browsing or keyword searching.<li>Some directories are organised using a traditional library classification.|
|Subject Gateway|<li>Focus on a particular subject area.<li>Often constructed by academic libraries, sometimes working in groups, or by associations/ organizations interested in a subject area.|
|**8**<br> Define Bibliographic Database|It is a collection of printed or numeric records which have been transformed and stored in a computer.|
|Example BC Database|LISA, ERIC, NSTP ONLINE, BINAR, MENTARI etc.|
|**9** <br>Define Bibliographic Utilities|An organization that provides access to, and support for, databases and information retrieval system, either directly to member libraries or through a network of regional service centers.|
|*Remark*|Consists of a large union bibliographic database, accessible online to time sharing.<br>A non-profit organization serving as a source of bibliographic data stored in machine readable form, which data are available to those affiliated with the utility.<br>The collection name for a group of computer service organizations that maintain large databases of cataloging records and offer various cataloging support services and related products to libraries and other customers who access those records on an on-line.|
|Two 2 kinds of information|<li>Descriptive cataloging <li> Classification data in MARC format.</li>Holding information for libraries that added spesific items to their collections.|
|Major bibliographic utilities|OCLC, RLIN, SILAS, AGRIS|
|Services of Bibliographic Utilities|<li>**Shared cataloguing:** Ease cataloguing and standardized cataloguing description & facilitate exchanging of records. <li>**Online union catalog:** Ease the process of retrieving cataloguing records. <li> **Acquisition Works:** Professionals in acquiring materials for collection development and easing selection. <li> **Online information searching:** Facilitate access to current & timely information <li> **Reference Service:** Help Information Professionals in providing an effective reference service.|
|Introduction OCLC|<li>Founded in Ohio (1967) – known as Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) by the Presidents of Ohio State colleges and universities. <li>Introduced as online shared cataloguing system for libraries in 1971.<li>OCLC was first demonstrated to librarians during IFLA & UNESCO seminar in Liverpool 1971.|
|Objectives of OCLC|To develop computerized system in which the libraries of Ohio academic institutions could share resources and reduce costs.|
|Products of OCLC|<ol><li>**Cataloging on World Cataloging Database:** Over 42 million cataloging records created by libraries around the world. Spans over 4000 years of recorded knowledge with 400 languages represented.<li>**Reference:** Offers FirstSearch, Sitesearch and Resource Sharing.<li> **Preservation:** Offers high quality preservation (microfilming & digitization) <li> **DDC:** Provides printed & electronic resources to help libraries use the DDC.|
|MALMARC|Early 1970s UNESCO mooted the idea of establish a regional information systems. UNESCO donated to Malaysia a complete set of the hardware needed for the proposed pilot project. Fostered the idea that the National Library and the libraries of UM, UKM, USM, UPM & UTM to consider linkages themselves. Introduces in 1978 due to PNM computerization process of its collection. The system was shared cataloguing system among university libraries and National Library of Malaysia. The coordinator for the MALMARC project was USM library – it have the most powerful computer among the universities involved.|
