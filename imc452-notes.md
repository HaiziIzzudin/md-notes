|What is metadata?|<ul><li>Data about data<li>An abstraction of the data.<li>Meaningful data describing another discrete data object.<li> Means that the relationship between data object and the metadata describing its functionally identical to the relationship between a book and its library catalog record.<li>Structured description of data object|
|What is Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)?|<ul><li>...is a metadata element set intended to facilitate discovery of electronic resources.|
|Why does it favoured over other Metadata Schemas?|Originally conceived for author - it has attracted the attention of formal resource description communities such as museums, libraries, government agencies and commercial organization.|
|Key characteristics of DCMI|<ol><li>Simplicity <li>Semantic interoperability <li>International consensus <li>Extensibility <li>Modularity|
|Describe more about DCMI|<ul><li>Positioned as a simple information resources description format.<li>Aims to provide a basis for semantic interoperability between other, often more complicated formats.<li>DC benefits from active participation and promotion in some 20 countries in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.<li>Representatives of the DC effort have helped to develop the Resources Description Framework (RDF), an infrastructure that supports coexistence of complementary, independently maintained metadata packages.|
|Give several properties used for DCMI schema.||
|4 Priciples of Metadata:|**1. Modularity**<ul><li>Characterized by  ***diverse sources of content, styles of content management, and approaches to resource description***. <li>Allows designers of metadata schemas to ***create new assemblies based on established metadata schemas*** and benefit from observed best practice. <li>Data elements from different schemas, vocabularies and other building blocks can be combined in a ***syntactically and semantically interoperable way***.</ul>**2. Extensibility**<ul><li>Must allow for ***extensions*** so that particular needs of a given application can be accommodated. <lI>Some metadata elements are ***likely to be found in most metadata schemas, while others will be specific to particular applications or domains***.<li>Must ***easily accommodate the notion of a base schema*** with additional elements that tailor a given application to local needs or domain-specific needs without  compromising the interoperability provided by the base schema.</ul>**3. Refinement**<ul><li>metadata standards should allow schema designers to ***choose a level of detail*** appropriate to a given application.<li>2 notions of refinement to consider:<ol><li>Addition of qualifiers that ***refine*** the meaning of an element. E.g.: *Illustrator, author, composer, or sculptor* are all particular types of general term *creator*.<li>***Specification*** of particular schemes or value sets that define the range of values for a given element. This way, semantic interoperability across applications can be increased by relying on a common value set.</ol></ul>**4. Multilingualism**<ul><li>The Web affords unprecedented access to resources.<li>Complementary processes of ***internationalization*** and ***localization***.<li>These two processes can sometimes work at cross-purposes. While global resource discovery is best served by internationalization, the needs of any given community may be better served by supporting local conventions.</ul>|
|9 Practicalities of Metadata:|<ol><li>**Application Profile**<br>Assemblage of metadata elements selected from one or more metadata schemas and combined in a compound schema.<li>**Syntax and Semantics**<br>Semantics is about meaning; syntax is about form.<li>**Association Models**<br>*Embedded metadata* resides within the markup of the resource. *Associated metadata* is maintained in files tightly coupled to the resources they describe. *Third-Party metadata* is maintained in a separate repository by an organization.<li>**Identifying and Naming Metadata Elements**<br>Particular tools and applications can use different presentation labels within their systems to make the labels more understandable and useful in a given linguistic, cultural, or domain context.<li>**Metadata Registries**<br>...provide the means to identify and refer to established schemas and application profiles, potentially including the means for machine mapping among different schemas.<li>**Completeness of Description**<br>...will be determined by policies and best practices designated by the agency creating the metadata, and those policies and practices will be guided by the functional requirements of services or applications. <li>**Mandatory Versus Optional Elements**<br>An element that is essential in one domain may not even be sensible in another, hence few, if any, elements in a general metadata set should be thought of as mandatory. <li>**Subjective and Objective Metadata**<br>*Objective metadata* can be machine generated in most instances, while *Subjective metadata* are specifically intended to represent a subjective evaluation.<li>**Automated Generation of Metadata**<br>...that can be automated to some degree, and which can be expected to grow in importance as advances in such areas as natural language processing, data mining, profile and pattern recognition algorithms become more effective.|
|5 Types of Metadata|<ol><li>***Administrative*** metadata in managing and administering informatio resources.<li>***Descriptive*** metadata used to describe or identify information resources (manual metadata created by people).<li>***Preservation*** metadata related to the preservation management of information resources.<li>***Technical*** metadata related to how a system functions or metadata behaves, file format and compression scheme.<li>***Use*** metadata related to the level and type of user information resources.|
|Attributes and characteristics of Metadatada|<ol><li>***Internal metadata source*** generated by creating agent for an information object at the time when it is first created or digitized.<li>***External metadata source*** relating to an information object that is created later, often by someone other than the original creator.<li>***Automatic metadata*** generated by a computer.<li>***Manual metadata*** created by people.|
|Nature of Metadata|Metadata created by persons who are neither subject nor information specialists, often the original creator of the information object.|
|Structure of Metadata|***Structured metadata*** that conforms to a predictable standardized structure.<br><br>***Unstructured metadata*** that does not conform to any standardized vocabulary or authority form.|
|Metadata Semantics|***Controlled metadata*** that conforms to a standardized vocabulary or authority form.<br><Br>***Uncontrolled metadata*** that does not conform to any standardized vocabulary or authority form|
|Level of Metadata|***Collection metadata*** relating to collections of information objects.<br><Br>***Expert metadata*** created by either subject or information specialists, often not the original creator of the information object.|
|Status of Metadata|***Static metadata*** that never change once it has been created. <br><br>***Dynamic metadata*** that may change with the use or manipulation of an information object.<br><br>***Long-term metadata*** necessary to ensure that the information object continues to be accessible and usable.<br><Br>***Short- term metadata*** mainly of a transactional nature|
|Item Metadata|...relating to individual information object often contained within collections.|
|Describe the creation of Metadata|<ol><li>***Creation and Identification:*** Capture and store records, Assign unique identifying information, Provide security, Support authentication clearance, Version control.<li>***Maintenance:*** Maintain and apply appraisal criteria and authorization.<li>***Control and Use:*** Facilitate internal and external records-communication, search and retrieval; Provision of tracking mechanisms; Facilitate migration, conversion and portability.<li>***Disposition:*** Notify creator/user of disposal; Dispose of records identified by retention schedule; Maintain archival information in independent format.|
|Guidance for Creation of Metadata|**Why?**<br>To maintain solely all records in electronic format it is essential to establish a formal, office wide system for creating, filing, labeling, and naming electronic records.<br><Br>**Advantage:**<br>for high turnover of personnel; Information is shared and routed electronically.<br><Br><ol><li>Saving Document<ol><li>Consider structure as of prime important.<li>Storing structure of the electronic records.<li>To make available, understandable and usable of records.<li>To consider operating system and its constraints </ol><li>Naming Conventions<ol><li>Standard Conventions must be available, widely used; and for naming the directories and the files stored under the directories.<li>Benefits:<ul><li>Documents can be easily and quickly located in personal or shared workspace, on diskettes, on backup systems or in off-site storage.<li>Reducing the risk of duplicating someone elseâ€™s work, therefore documents can be reused.<li>The file name can be used to distinguish final versions from drafts.</ul><li>Best to use *standard abbreviations* whenever possible because: <ol><li>Records Manager can identify abbreviations already in use. <li>Government telephone directory often contain abbreviations for names of departments and agencies. <li>Post offices also provide abbreviations for region-place <li>Department wide conventions for names of individuals, locations can be developed and disseminated. </ol></ol>|
|Give 3 different perspective of metadata|<ol><li>Content<ul><li>Elements or individual pieces of data combined in the database. <li>Content can be manipulated and viewed or printed out in endless configurations. <li>Content will change over time, continually updated, deleted and replaced with new information. </ul><li>Context<ul><li>Identifies the provenance of the record (person or system responsible for creating it). <li>Provides data that supports its use as evidence of a transaction. </ul><li>Structure<ul><li>Information about the design of data or record Defines the logical constructs that make up a record.</ul>|
